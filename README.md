## Data Setup
1. Download the Ninapro DB2 dataset from [Ninapro](http://ninapro.hevs.ch/).
2. Extract it so your folder looks like:
   ./data/DB2/DB2_s1/
   ./data/DB2/DB2_s2/
   ...
3. Run the code. By default, it looks for data in `./data/DB2`.
   If your data is elsewhere, set the `EMG_DATA_PATH` environment variable.
